Getting started with Github
================

## 1\. Create a Github account.

  - See *Happy Git*,
    [Chapter 4](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html).

## 2\. Create a repository.

  - See *Happy Git*,
    [Section 15.1](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html), for
    the basics.
  - While creating the repository, two extra steps will make future
    course work easier.
  - Check the box to ‘Initialize this Repository with a README.’
  - Set the ‘Add .gitignore’ button to R.
  - Leave the ‘Add a license’ button alone for now.

## 3\. Add a licence (optional).

  - From your Github repository page, click the ‘Create new file’
    button.
  - Name the file ‘LICENSE’, using all capitals.
  - [Choose a licence](https://choosealicense.com) and copy its text to
    the clipboard.
  - *My recommendation is CC-BY-4.0, which is accessible from ‘My
    project isn’t software.’*
  - Click the green ‘Commit new file’ button at the bottom of the page.

## 4\. Make the repository a web page.

  - From your Github repository page, click the Settings tab.
  - Under the Github Pages heading, change the Source button from ‘None’
    to ‘master branch’.
  - Github should now say that your site is published and give a link to
    its web page. Use this link for submitting homework assignments and
    the final portfolio.
