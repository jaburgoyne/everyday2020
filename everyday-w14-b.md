flexdashboard Basics
================

## Learning `flexdashboard`

We’ll review the highlights of the `flexdashboard` documentation
together.

Pay particular attention to the layout possibilities.

  - How many pages do you think you will want/need?
  - Which pages will be best served by a column layout and which by a
    row layout?
  - Will you use tabs anywhere?  
  - Which panes will have descriptive text and which will have
    visualizations?

## Setting up your portfolio

1.  Install the `flexdashboard` package.
2.  Create a new file called `index.Rmd` in your RStudio project.
      - Choose R Markdown from the <File:New> File menu and use the
        `flexdashboard` template.
3.  Enter the basic structure you decided upon for your portfolio.
4.  Choose a theme.
5.  Knit your R Markdown file.
6.  Commit and push to Github.
7.  After a few minutes, you should be able to see our dashboard at
    <http://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME>

## Collaborate with Github (optional but highly recommended)

1.  Choose one member of your group to manage the project repository.
2.  That member needs to add the other group members as collaborators
    from Github (under Settings:Manage Access).

  - In order to add everybody, you will need a Github Pro account. That
    is free for students by making a request at
    <https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new>

<!-- end list -->

3.  Each non-managing member should create a new RStudio Project from
    version control, using the Repository URL of the managing member’s
    repository.
4.  In addition to committing and pushing, you now will want to Pull
    occasionally, to bring in other members’ updates.
5.  Be sure to commit and push often to avoid conflicts\! Usually git is
    smart about merging multiple changes, but not always.
